Amber and I welcomed her to our family last June. We adopted Bam-Bam from an organization that had rescued her from the clutches of an unethical breeder. The poor creature lived in unsanitary conditions and was forced to deliver many batches of litters, without care for her own health. As a consequence of exposure to an unhealthy environment and gross negligence towards her well-being, she contracted tapeworms. Unkept backyards often harbor dirty, wet patches and stagnant water, which are fertile breeding grounds for mosquitoes. They are carriers for extremely harmful parasites, such as heartworms among others. Fortunately, Bam-Bam didn't contract heartworms and was treated promptly for tapeworms to prevent any major infection. We are so thankful for the rescue. Now, she takes a monthly preventative medicine to be safe from parasites. For the concerned reader, parasites such as tapeworm or heartworm do not spread to humans through contact with dogs.

Bam-Bam is 12 lbs, with hypoallergenic, white and light-brown hair with grey accents, and a slender body. From first impressions, one might guess that she is a cavachon, a mix of a cavalier and a Bichon Frise, or just a simple poodle mix. After recognizing certain features such as her longer body and a very soft coat, we were curious to find out if it was actually true. So, we sent a saliva sample for DNA testing, and the results revealed that she is a mix of three pure breeds. She is 55% Maltese, 25% Schnauzer, and 20% Cocker Spaniel. It was surprising to learn that there are no poodle genes at all. The Cocker Spaniel mix explains her long, slender body. Her behaviour on sniff walks is reminiscent of Schnauzers that love sniffing out rodents in the barns. Her soft, low-shedding coat, along with her calmness indoors and fondness to be a lap dog, are characteristics of a Maltese. In reality, she was a perfect mix for us, no matter what the percentages and breeds turned out to be!

We are so happy that she now has a safe home and regular food to thrive. Every morning, she wakes us up with cute, feeble attempts to talk like a human, which is her way of telling us it’s time to go outside. She is explorative during the walks and loves the breezy outdoors. To our inadvertent benefit, she likes to go on long walks around the neighborhood, which gives us the all-important early morning sunlight for our circadian rhythm and provides light physical exercise to replenish our bodies with oxygen. Because of Bam-Bam, our days are spent with vigor and energy as she keeps on bringing ripples of positive effects. We go for two more walks each day, one in the afternoon and one before going to bed. Altogether, these add up to more than 10,000 steps a day. Fascinating how a good deed compounds favorable outcomes.

The greatest superpower Bam-Bam possesses is her ability to turn our bleakest working days around. She unerringly melts our worries away with her gleaming affection, trust, and innocence. One of my happiest moments of each day is returning home from work to be welcomed by an on-rushing, frolicky, cute blob of love pacing down the stairs. She emphatically wags her tail with happiness, eager to give cuddles and licks. As an enabling doggy dad, I give her a tasty treat, which she then takes to the couch to enjoy after a charismatic leap. 

Alrighty, later then! Time to give some pets!
