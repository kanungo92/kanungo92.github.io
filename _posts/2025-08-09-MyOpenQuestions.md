title: My list of open questions
---

<span class="highlight-blue">Dear World,</span>

The following are my open questions that I keep revisiting to reflect on everyday.
 1. How can lessons learnt from doing experiments be efficiently disseminated into the general public?
    1. How to equip people to tell the difference between what is actually true? How is falsehood defined? 
 2. How can we find ways to express human thoughts and feelings with physical measureable quantities? Can they be modelled? Does a mapping exist?
 3. Entropy creates disorder. Then what does give rise to the emergence of ordered systems, albeit temporary? What agencies are in the competition to favor disorder vs order?
